# US Medical Insurance Costs Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes an insurance dataset with the aim of understanding the factors that contribute to insurance charges. The dataset contains information on individuals' personal and health attributes such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and medical costs. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and inferential analysis, we will identify trends and relationships between these variables, with a focus on predicting and understanding the impact of specific factors, such as age and smoking, on insurance costs.

## Key Objectives

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform data cleaning, summary statistics, and data visualizations to understand the relationships between variables and identify patterns in the dataset.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examine the correlation between variables, in particular the relationship between age, smoking, and insurance costs.
- **Bias Identification**: Identify potential biases in the dataset, including geographical, sampling, self-selection, and reporting biases.
- **Linear Regression**: Implement linear regression to predict insurance premiums based on key factors such as age and smoking status.

## Data Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Age**: The age of the individual.
- **Gender**: The sex of the individual (male/female).
- **BMI**: The body mass index of the individual.
- **Children**: The number of children or dependents covered by the policy.
- **Smoker**: Whether the person is a smoker (yes/no).
- **Region**: The geographical region of the person in the United States.
- **Cost**: The health insurance charges incurred by the individual.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Seaborn**
- **Matplotlib**

## Installing the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/US-medical-insurance.git
cd US-medical-insurance
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

### Loading the Data:
The dataset can be loaded using the `pandas` library. The `data.csv` file contains the raw data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploratory data analysis is performed directly in the Jupyter notebook or scripts provided. It includes data cleaning, summary statistics, and visualizations such as histograms and box plots.

### Correlation Analysis:
You can compute and visualize the correlation matrix in your Jupyter notebook. The analysis will provide insight into the relationships between different variables, particularly how age, smoking, and other factors correlate with insurance charges.

### Linear Regression:
Use a linear regression model in your Jupyter notebook to predict insurance premiums based on age, smoking status, and other relevant variables.

### Results & Findings:
All analysis results, including visualizations and model outputs, are displayed in the terminal or in a Jupyter notebook.

## Potential Biases in the Dataset

During the analysis of the dataset, we identified several potential sources of bias that could affect the generalizability of our findings:

- **Geographical Bias**: The dataset includes data from only four regions in the US, limiting the ability to extrapolate findings to other regions or countries.
- **Sampling Bias**: The dataset may not fully represent the broader population, as it may over-represent certain medical conditions or socio-economic backgrounds.
- **Self-selection Bias**: The dataset only includes people who have health insurance, excluding the uninsured.
- **Reporting Bias**: Self-reported data may contain inaccuracies that affect the quality and reliability of the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project explores the factors that contribute to health insurance costs, with a particular focus on understanding how age, smoking status, and other personal characteristics influence these costs. While the findings may help to improve predictions and guide decision making, it is important to acknowledge the potential biases in the dataset that may limit the generalizability of the results.

## Future Work

- Expand the dataset by including more diverse geographic regions and socioeconomic backgrounds.
- Implement advanced machine learning models to improve the accuracy of charge predictions.
- Address potential biases by incorporating additional data sources.
